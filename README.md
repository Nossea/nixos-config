# nixos-config
This is Nossea's personalized Nixos configuration.

Feel free to do whatever you like with these configs but please understand that I am not obligated to assist you with any technical issues you may face as a result of using them.

The [[Nixos Wiki]](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Main_Page) the [[Unoffical Nixos Discord]](https://discord.gg/ub4bFnKhYY) and many content creators including [[No Boilerplate]](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUMwY9iS8oMyWDYIe6_RmoA) and [[Vimjoyer]](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_zBdZ0_H_jn41FDRG7q4Tw) are excellent resources for starting out if you are interested in Nixos and it's incredible capabilities.

I wish you the best of luck and hope that my own config is of some use.
